# nginx-auth-saslauthd

This [nginx](https://nginx.org/) utility verifies web users with Basic
authentication and LDAP, PAM or other mechanisms supported by the saslauthd
daemon from [Cyrus SASL](https://www.cyrusimap.org/sasl/).  Authentication
requests are forwarded from nginx with the
[auth_request](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_auth_request_module.html)
directive.

    location /private/ {
        auth_request /auth;
    }

    location = /auth {
        internal;
        proxy_pass http://unix:/run/nginx-auth/saslauthd.sock:/auth-basic;
        proxy_pass_request_body off;
        proxy_set_header Content-Length "";
        proxy_set_header X-Realm "Restricted";
    }
