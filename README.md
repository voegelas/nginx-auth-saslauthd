# nginx-auth-saslauthd

This nginx utility verifies web users with Basic authentication and LDAP, PAM
or other mechanisms supported by saslauthd. Authentication requests are
forwarded from nginx with the
[auth_request](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_auth_request_module.html)
directive.

```Nginx
location /private/ {
    auth_request /auth;
}

location = /auth {
    internal;
    proxy_pass http://unix:/run/nginx-auth/http.sock:/auth-basic;
    proxy_pass_request_body off;
    proxy_set_header Content-Length "";
    proxy_set_header X-Realm "Restricted";
}
```
