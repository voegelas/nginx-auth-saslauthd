# nginx-auth-saslauthd

This nginx utility verifies web users with Basic authentication and saslauthd.
Authentication requests are forwarded from nginx to this software with
[auth_request](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_auth_request_module.html).

```Nginx
location /private {
    auth_request /auth-basic;
}

location = /auth-basic {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8888;
    proxy_pass_request_body off;
    proxy_set_header Content-Length "";
    proxy_set_header X-Realm "Restricted";
    proxy_set_header X-Saslauthd-Path "/var/run/saslauthd/mux";
}
```
